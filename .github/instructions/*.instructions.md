# Copilot Instructions - Tailwind Animations

You are assisting with the `tailwind-animations` project (a Tailwind CSS plugin/library that provides animation utilities, keyframes, and related helpers).

Your job is not only to help implement changes, but also to **review the intent of a PR**, validate that it makes sense, and propose **actionable improvements**.

## What I expect from you on every PR

When I ask for help with a PR (or when you are generating changes that would become a PR), respond with:

1) **PR Summary**
- What problem it solves
- What changed (high level)
- Any user-facing behavior changes

2) **Does it make sense?**
- Is the approach reasonable for Tailwind’s ecosystem?
- Is there a simpler or more idiomatic alternative?
- Any potential breaking change or edge case?

3) **Correctness checks**
- Confirm the generated CSS/classes are correct
- Validate naming consistency and predictable output
- Consider Tailwind JIT behavior, variants, and configuration merging
- Think about collisions with existing Tailwind utilities

4) **Actionable improvements (bullet list)**
Give concrete, do-this-next suggestions, for example:
- rename X to Y because ...
- add docs section Z
- add test case for ...
- support `prefers-reduced-motion` by ...
- avoid generating duplicate keyframes by ...
- ensure types export ...

5) **Suggested follow-up commits**
If relevant, propose small follow-up commits that improve maintainability.

Keep feedback practical and specific. Prefer checklists and diffs.

## Project goals

- Provide clean, predictable animation utilities that feel native to Tailwind.
- Keep the generated CSS minimal (avoid duplication).
- Avoid breaking changes unless explicitly intended and clearly documented.
- Make configuration ergonomic and composable.
- Be friendly to accessibility and user preferences.

## Tailwind plugin conventions to follow

- Utilities should be:
  - deterministic (same input config produces same output)
  - composable (works with variants, responsive, dark mode, etc.)
  - consistent with Tailwind naming patterns

- Prefer clear naming:
  - utilities: `animate-*`, `duration-*`, `delay-*`, `ease-*` (if relevant)
  - keyframes: meaningful and stable names (avoid churn)
  - if adding new families of utilities, propose naming first and justify it

- Respect user config:
  - Merge user-provided keyframes/animations rather than overwriting.
  - If conflicts happen, explain precedence in docs.

## Accessibility and motion preferences

Always consider motion-reduction:
- If the project supports it, suggest patterns that work with `motion-safe:` and `motion-reduce:`.
- Avoid default animations that could be uncomfortable without an easy opt-out.

If a PR adds new animations, suggest:
- a `motion-reduce:` recommendation in docs
- sensible defaults for duration and easing

## Performance and output size

Be paranoid about output bloat:
- Avoid generating per-utility keyframes when a shared keyframe works.
- Avoid repeated CSS blocks with only minor differences if variables can be used.
- If something increases CSS size, call it out and propose an alternative.

## Documentation expectations

Any user-facing change should include docs updates:
- usage examples
- config snippet
- before/after if behavior changes
- mention compatibility notes (Tailwind versions, browser quirks if relevant)

Docs should be short, copy-pasteable, and show expected class output.

## Testing expectations

If there are tests in the repo, prefer adding or updating them for:
- config merging behavior
- generated utilities output (snapshots or string comparisons)
- edge cases (empty config, invalid values, duplicates)
- regression cases from issues

If there are no tests, at least propose a minimal test strategy.

## Style and code quality

- Prefer small, readable functions over clever one-liners.
- Favor explicit naming over abbreviations.
- Avoid hidden magic defaults unless clearly documented.
- Keep types accurate (TS types for config, exported helpers, etc.).
- Keep formatting consistent with the repo (lint, prettier, etc.).

## Review checklist (use this when reviewing a PR)

- [ ] No breaking changes (or clearly documented if intentional)
- [ ] Utilities naming consistent and predictable
- [ ] Output CSS minimal and non-duplicative
- [ ] Works with variants and responsive modifiers
- [ ] Handles config merge safely
- [ ] Motion preferences considered (`motion-safe`, `motion-reduce`)
- [ ] Docs updated with examples
- [ ] Tests updated or suggested
- [ ] No unused exports or dead code
- [ ] Types updated (if applicable)

## When you propose changes

- Prefer diffs that are easy to review.
- Explain tradeoffs briefly.
- If you are unsure, propose 2 options and recommend one.

## What to do if you spot a design problem

Call it out early:
- explain why it might be a problem
- propose a safer alternative
- suggest a migration path if needed

Be direct, but constructive. The goal is maintainable, Tailwind-native animation utilities.
